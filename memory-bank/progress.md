# Progress: AI Study Companion (As of 2025-04-13 ~8:20 PM ET)

## 1. What Works

-   **Basic Application Structure:** Next.js app with App Router, basic layout, and routing.
-   **UI:** Core UI components using Shadcn UI, including the file upload interface (`components/upload.tsx`).
-   **Configuration:** Centralized config (`lib/config.ts`) loading from environment variables. Client-side config exposure via `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix works.
-   **Internationalization:** Basic i18n setup with `lib/translations.ts` and `useLanguage` hook.
-   **Document Upload:** Users can select or drag-and-drop files.
-   **File Validation (Frontend):**
    -   Checks for allowed types (.txt, .docx, .pdf).
    -   Checks against configurable max file size (default 25MB) using `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB`. Error message dynamically shows the correct limit.
    -   Checks word count limits for non-PDF files.
-   **Non-PDF Processing:** `.txt` and `.docx` files have text extracted directly on the client/server (using `mammoth` likely via `lib/document-converter.ts`) and validated.
-   **PDF Text Extraction (Server-side):**
    -   Uses `pdf-parse` server-side within API route (`/api/pdf-extract`).
    -   API route receives the file, reads the buffer, extracts text (no temporary files needed).
    -   Asynchronous job status tracking via Redis (`pdf-job:{jobId}`) is implemented.
    -   Client polls status endpoint (`/api/pdf-extract/status/[jobId]`) and updates progress UI.
-   **Error Handling:** Error dialog (`components/error-dialog.tsx`) displays errors encountered during validation or processing.
-   **Build Process:** The `pdf-parse` library was patched using `pnpm patch` to remove debug code, resolving build failures.
-   **JSON Parsing:** Three-tiered parsing strategy for handling AI responses:
    -   Direct parsing with standard `JSON.parse()`
    -   Targeted repair for common syntax issues
    -   Structure-specific pattern extraction for severely malformed responses
-   **Flashcard Study Flow:**
    -   Flashcard viewer (`app/flashcards/page.tsx`) displays question/answer.
    -   AI generates flashcards in batches of 10.
    -   Navigation between cards works with proper button layout.
    -   Summary page (`app/summary/page.tsx`) shows studied cards and provides option to finish.
    -   Skeleton loading state for initial and subsequent batch generation.
    -   Card counter resets for each batch.
-   **Difficulty Selection:**
    -   `DifficultySelector` component with star-based UI (1-5 stars)
    -   Internationalized descriptions for each difficulty level
    -   Affects both flashcard and MCQ generation through AI prompts
    -   Higher difficulties (4-5) trigger smaller batch sizes for more reliable generation
-   **Progress Tracking:**
    -   `ProgressContext` for tracking generation progress
    -   Used for both flashcard and MCQ batch generation
    -   Shows chunk progress during multi-batch operations
-   **Theme System:**
    -   Light mode with warm beige/cream tones
    -   Dark mode with dark grey backgrounds and orange accents
    -   Consistent use of CSS variables through Tailwind classes

## 2. What's Left to Build / Verify

-   **MCQ Implementation:** 
    -   Backend generation is functional with proper JSON parsing/repair
    -   MCQ quiz interface (`app/mcq/page.tsx`) needs to be implemented
    -   MCQ summary page (`app/mcq-summary/page.tsx`) needs to be created
    -   User answer selection and scoring system need to be implemented
    -   Results display and feedback mechanism need to be added
-   **Integration Testing:**
    -   Full MCQ flow from generation to completion
    -   Difficulty selection integration with MCQ generation
    -   Error handling and edge cases for MCQ flow
-   **Results Display:** Implement the page showing the generated course overview/outline.
-   **Authentication Flow:** Integrate Clerk authentication more deeply if needed beyond basic setup.
-   **Deployment:** Configure and test deployment (e.g., on Vercel).
-   **Robustness/Edge Cases:** Further testing of PDF extraction, AI generation, and the study flows with various inputs and potential errors.
-   **Alternative Storage for Large Text:** Monitor need for alternative storage (Vercel Blob, S3) for extracted text if Redis limits become an issue.

## 3. Current Status

-   Core file upload and text extraction pipeline is functional for all supported file types.
-   Background processing for PDFs with status polling works reliably.
-   Frontend validation (size, type, word count) is comprehensive.
-   Flashcard generation and study flow is fully functional with proper batching and loading states.
-   MCQ generation backend is implemented but frontend interface is still in development.
-   Difficulty selection system is implemented and affects content generation.
-   Progress tracking context is in place and used for generation feedback.
-   Theme system has been updated and verified for both light and dark modes.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

-   **Redis Size Limit (Potential):** While mitigated by the frontend limit, storing large extracted text (even from <25MB PDFs) in Redis might still hit limits or be inefficient. This needs monitoring or a proactive change to alternative storage.
-   **Peer Dependency Warnings:** Warnings exist during `pnpm install` related to React/date-fns versions. Need investigation if they cause runtime issues.
-   **`pdf-parse` Limitations:** Need to verify its performance and accuracy with various PDF structures, especially complex ones, during testing.
