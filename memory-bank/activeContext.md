# Active Context - AI Study Companion

## Current Focus

Implementing and refining the MCQ (Multiple-Choice Questions) feature across the application. This includes completing the MCQ generation flow, quiz interface, and ensuring proper integration with the existing difficulty system.

## Recent Changes

- **MCQ Implementation Progress:**
    - Created `types/mcq.ts` with comprehensive type definitions:
        - `McqQuestion` interface with question text, options (A-D), correct answer, and user selection tracking
        - `McqSessionData` interface for tracking study sessions (questions, score, completion status)
        - `DifficultyLevel` type (1-5) for type safety in question generation
    - Implemented robust difficulty system:
        - Added `DifficultySelector` component with star-based UI for selecting difficulty levels 1-5
        - Added internationalized difficulty descriptions in `lib/translations.ts`
        - Modified `lib/ai/prompts.ts` with detailed difficulty-specific prompts:
            - Specific vocabulary complexity, word limits, and question structure based on difficulty
            - Enhanced prompting for higher difficulty levels (4-5) to generate more challenging questions
        - Integrated difficulty parameter handling in `lib/ai/service.ts` and `app/api/ai/route.ts`
        - Added batch size adjustment based on difficulty level (smaller batches for higher difficulty)
    - Enhanced AI service layer:
        - Added MCQ-specific generation in `generateMCQs` and `generateSingleMCQBatch` functions
        - Implemented progress tracking via callback pattern
        - Added specialized JSON repair/extraction for MCQ structure
    - Integrated ProgressContext system:
        - Created context provider for tracking generation progress
        - Added to app providers in `app/providers.tsx`
        - Implemented tracking of chunk generation progress for batched operations

- **Theme Update Verification:**
    - Confirmed successful application of warm beige/cream theme for light mode
    - Verified dark theme updates with dark grey backgrounds and orange accents
    - Confirmed Start button styling using `bg-accent-orange` in both modes

- **API Enhancements:**
    - Enhanced word count validation in `app/api/ai/route.ts` for both minimum and maximum limits
    - Added robust error handling with specific error types
    - Added validation for MCQ generation parameters

## Recent Changes

- **Content Processing Optimization:**
    - Changed transcript chunking from character-based to word-based limits
    - Updated threshold from 30,000 characters to 15,000 words
    - Implemented word counting logic in `lib/ai.ts` with the `countWords` function
    - Modified `extractSampleFromTranscript` to preserve beginning, middle, and end portions based on word count
    - Updated all AI generation functions to use word count threshold instead of character count

## Next Steps

1. **Complete MCQ Study Interface:**
   - Implement MCQ quiz page (`app/mcq/page.tsx`) with question display and option selection
   - Create MCQ summary page (`app/mcq-summary/page.tsx`) to display results
   - Add scoring and feedback mechanisms for completed questions

2. **Integration Testing:**
   - Test full MCQ flow from generation to summary
   - Verify integration between difficulty selection and content generation
   - Test error handling and edge cases

3. **UI/UX Refinements:**
   - Add progress indicators for MCQ completion
   - Ensure consistent design language across flashcard and MCQ interfaces
   - Verify responsive design on different screen sizes

4. **Feature Parity:**
   - Ensure MCQ feature has similar capabilities to flashcards (generation options, progress tracking)
   - Consider adding explanations for correct answers in MCQ results
   - Implement result analysis for completed MCQ sessions

5. **Documentation:**
   - Update user documentation to include MCQ feature instructions
   - Consider adding developer documentation for MCQ-specific components
