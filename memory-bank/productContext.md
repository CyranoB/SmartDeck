# Product Context: AI Study Companion

## 1. Problem Solved

Students often struggle with effectively reviewing large amounts of course material (lecture transcripts, readings, notes). Traditional study methods can be time-consuming and may not always lead to optimal retention. This application aims to streamline the study process by automatically generating targeted study aids from the students' own materials.

## 2. How It Should Work

1.  **Upload:** The user uploads a document (.txt, .docx, .pdf) containing course material.
2.  **Validation:** The system checks the file type and size (configurable limit, default 25MB). Word count is also checked for non-PDF files upfront, and for PDFs after text extraction.
3.  **Processing:**
    *   Text is extracted from the document. PDF extraction happens asynchronously in the background via an API route, with status tracked in Redis.
    *   The extracted text is sent to an AI model (OpenAI).
4.  **Generation:** The AI generates study materials based on the text (e.g., flashcards, multiple-choice questions).
5.  **Review & Study:** The user is presented with the generated materials and can choose a study mode (flashcards, MCQ) to interact with them.
6.  **Configuration:** Users can manage their OpenAI API key and potentially select different AI models.

## 3. User Experience Goals

-   **Simplicity:** The upload and generation process should be straightforward and intuitive.
-   **Efficiency:** Reduce the manual effort required to create study materials.
-   **Effectiveness:** Provide high-quality, relevant study aids generated by AI.
-   **Feedback:** Keep the user informed about processing status (especially for PDFs) and provide clear error messages.
-   **Responsiveness:** The application should work well on various screen sizes.
-   **Customization:** Allow basic configuration (API key, language).
