## Product Overview

The AI Flashcard Generator is a modern, serverless web application designed to help university students study more efficiently by transforming uploaded course transcripts into flashcards and multiple choice questions. Until now, the system has been entirely session-based, storing temporary data in sessionStorage without user authentication. With the addition of social login, the application will enable students to authenticate using their social accounts. This enhancement will support:

- **User convenience:** By allowing sign-in via familiar providers (e.g., Google, Facebook, etc.) instead of requiring separate credentials.
- **Persistent personalization:** Enabling future enhancements such as study history, saved sessions, and a personalized dashboard.
- **Enhanced security:** Through OAuth 2.0–based authentication and secure session management using cookies rather than purely client-side sessionStorage.


## Objectives

- **Seamless Social Login Integration:** Implement authentication that leverages popular social providers using OAuth 2.0 (e.g., via NextAuth.js or a similar framework).
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Offer a “Sign In” button in the global/header UI; when authenticated, display the user’s profile or avatar. In addition, provide an option to log out.
- **Future Personalization:** Lay the groundwork for persistence of study history and other personalized features once a user is authenticated.
- **Security \& Privacy:** Ensure that the social authentication process follows industry best practices (secure cookies, proper token handling, and robust error reporting).


## Target Audience

- **University Students:** Who want an easy, password-free login process and the ability to save their study sessions.
- **Learners Seeking Personalization:** Those who appreciate having a user dashboard to track and review past study sessions.
- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Who wish to use secure, well-known social accounts without creating yet another set of credentials.


## Features and Requirements

### 1. Social Authentication Capability (High Priority)

- **Integration with OAuth Providers:**
    - Must support at least one primary social provider (Google initially) with the possibility to expand the list (Facebook, GitHub, etc.).
    - Use an OAuth framework such as NextAuth.js for easier integration with Next.js.
- **User Interface Changes:**
    - Add a “Sign In” button to the header (adjacent to the language and theme toggles).
    - Once authenticated, replace the “Sign In” button with the user avatar or display name and a “Sign Out” option.
- **Fallback and Error Handling:**
    - Provide clear error messages if social login fails.
    - For users who prefer the anonymous experience, allow continuation without authentication.


### 2. Persistent (Optional) User Session and Dashboard (Medium Priority)

- **Session Management:**
    - Transition from using only sessionStorage for storing transient data to also storing authenticated session information in secure HTTP-only cookies.
    - Establish secure session handling as part of the social login flow.
- **Future Expansion Possibility:**
    - Create a framework for a user dashboard where authenticated users can eventually review saved study sessions, flashcard history, and performance data.
    - For now, focus on the authentication and basic session persistence.


### 3. API and Backend Adjustments (High Priority)

- **New API Endpoints:**
    - Create endpoints or middleware to handle OAuth callbacks and session creation.
    - Update `/api/*` routes (if necessary) to check for and handle authenticated user data.
- **Security Considerations:**
    - Store sensitive configuration (e.g., OAuth client IDs and secrets) in environment variables.
    - Ensure token exchange, session creation, and cleanup follow secure practices.
- **User Data Storage:**
    - Although long-term persistence was previously out of scope, note that user information (name, email or unique ID provided by social providers) may be stored temporarily to personalize the user experience.


### 4. Frontend UI Changes (High Priority)

- **Header Modification:**
    - Update the global layout (`/app/layout.tsx`) to show a “Sign In” button if the user is not authenticated.
    - When authenticated, show the user’s avatar or name with a dropdown including a “Sign Out” option.
- **Login/Callback Pages:**
    - Create any necessary pages to support the OAuth callback (if using NextAuth.js, this could be handled automatically by the library).
- **Protected Routes (Optional):**
    - Determine if any pages (e.g., a future dashboard) should be gated behind authentication and implement appropriate redirects.


## User Stories

1. **As a student,** I want to log in with my Google account so that I do not have to create a new password.
2. **As a student,** I want to see my profile picture or name in the application header so that I know I am logged in.
3. **As a user,** I want to securely log out so that I can end my session when using a shared device.
4. **As a student preparing for exams,** I want to eventually access my study history (once backend persistence is expanded) so that I can track my progress over multiple sessions.

## Design Specifications

- **UI Components:**
    - Extend the current design system (using Tailwind CSS and shadcn components) to include authentication UI elements.
    - Ensure that the “Sign In” button is prominent and matches the modern, minimalistic aesthetic.
- **Error Handling and Visual Feedback:**
    - Use consistent visual cues (e.g., toast notifications) when there are authentication errors.
- **Responsive Design:**
    - All authentication-related views (login buttons, user dropdowns) must be responsive and work well on mobile and desktop.


## Technical Requirements

- **OAuth Integration:**
    - Leverage libraries such as NextAuth.js that simplify OAuth flows in Next.js.
    - Configure and test OAuth flow with at least Google as a provider.
- **Session Management:**
    - Implement secure, HTTP-only cookies to manage authenticated sessions.
    - Adjust the API endpoints for any authentication requirements.
- **Environment:**
    - Update environment configuration to include new variables (e.g., GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET).
    - Ensure that the deployment platform (Vercel) is configured to securely handle these new environment variables.
- **Testing:**
    - Conduct thorough end-to-end testing to ensure that the social login flow works seamlessly.
    - Include both automated tests (if available) and manual tests across different browsers and devices.


## Assumptions and Constraints

- **Integration Scope:**
    - Social login is a new feature and will add minor complexity to the otherwise stateless design.
    - No additional long-term user data storage is planned immediately—data may be stored temporarily for session personalization.
- **User Choice:**
    - Users must be allowed to use the application anonymously if they choose not to sign in.
- **Provider Limitations:**
    - Initially, only one provider (Google) will be supported, with future expansion to other social logins if needed.


## Release Criteria

- Users can successfully start an OAuth login flow via a “Sign In” button.
- The application correctly displays a user’s profile information upon successful login.
- Authenticated sessions are maintained securely using HTTP-only cookies.
- Error and fallback states are clearly communicated to the user.
- The “Sign Out” functionality cleanly terminates the user's session and reverts the UI to the non-authenticated state.


## Success Metrics

- **User Adoption:**
    - Percentage of users choosing to log in via social accounts versus proceeding anonymously.
- **Login Success Rate:**
    - Minimized error rate during the OAuth login flow.
- **User Engagement:**
    - Increased session durations and potential future usage of personalized dashboard features.
- **Security:**
    - Zero security incidents related to authentication and user data during a defined monitoring period.
