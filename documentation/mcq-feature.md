# Product Requirements Document for Multiple Choice Questions Addition

## Document Metadata
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: March 23, 2025
- **Author**: AI Assistant

## Product Overview
This PRD outlines the addition of a multiple choice question (MCQ) feature to the existing AI Flashcard Generator application. Currently, the application allows users to upload course transcripts, which are analyzed by AI to generate flashcards for study purposes. The new feature will provide an alternative study method through multiple choice questions, enhancing the learning experience with interactive assessment and feedback.

## Objectives
- Extend the current application to offer multiple choice questions as an alternative to flashcards
- Provide meaningful assessment feedback through a dedicated MCQ summary screen
- Maintain the application's user-friendly interface and smooth flow
- Improve learning outcomes by allowing users to test their knowledge in different formats

## Target Audience
University students and learners who:
- Prefer interactive testing to reinforce knowledge
- Want to measure their understanding of course material
- Are preparing for standardized tests that use multiple choice format
- Have different learning preferences beyond traditional flashcards

## Features and Requirements

### 1. Study Mode Selection (High Priority)
- After viewing the course subject and outline, users must be able to choose between:
  - Flashcards (existing functionality)
  - Multiple Choice Questions (new functionality)
- The selection UI should be clear, intuitive, and equally weighted for both options
- Include brief descriptions of each mode to help users understand the difference

### 2. Multiple Choice Question Interface (High Priority)
- Create a dedicated MCQ page that displays:
  - The question text
  - 4 possible answer choices (A, B, C, D)
  - Clear indication of which answers are selected
  - Navigation controls (submit answer, next question)
  - Progress indicator showing question number and total questions
- Track and store user selections and correct/incorrect status for each question

### 3. MCQ Generation (High Priority)
- Extend the AI API to generate multiple choice questions with:
  - A clear question stem
  - One correct answer
  - Three plausible but incorrect distractors
  - Questions based on the uploaded transcript content
  - Varied question difficulty and cognitive levels

### 4. MCQ Summary Screen (High Priority)
- Develop a dedicated summary screen that shows:
  - Overall score (number and percentage correct)
  - All questions encountered during the session
  - The user's selected answer for each question
  - The correct answer for each question
  - Visual highlighting of incorrect answers
  - Option to return to home screen

### 5. Session Data Management (Medium Priority)
- Store MCQ session data using the same approach as flashcards (sessionStorage)
- Include question text, all answer options, correct answer, user's selection, and correctness status
- Clear data appropriately when starting a new session

## User Stories
1. "As a student, I want to choose between flashcards and multiple choice questions so I can practice in the format that best suits my current study needs."
2. "As a student preparing for an exam, I want to test my knowledge with multiple choice questions so I can simulate the testing environment."
3. "As a user, I want to see which MCQs I answered incorrectly so I can focus on those topics in future study sessions."
4. "As a student, I want to see my overall performance score so I can track my progress and understanding."

## Technical Requirements

### Multiple Choice Question Generation
- Extend the AI prompt template to create meaningful multiple choice questions
- Ensure questions have varying difficulty levels
- Generate questions that test different cognitive skills (recall, application, analysis)
- Include 4 answer choices for each question (1 correct, 3 incorrect)

### MCQ Interface
- Build a responsive UI for displaying questions and answer choices
- Implement answer selection functionality
- Track user performance (correct/incorrect)
- Store session data for summary display

### MCQ Summary Interface
- Display overall performance statistics
- List all questions with correct/incorrect indicators
- Highlight incorrect answers
- Show the correct answer for all questions

## Assumptions and Constraints
- The existing AI integration with OpenAI is sufficient for generating quality MCQs
- Session-based storage is adequate for tracking user progress
- The application will maintain its serverless architecture
- The feature should work within the current word limit constraints for transcript uploads

## Release Criteria
- Users can successfully choose between flashcards and MCQs
- MCQs are correctly generated with appropriate answer options
- User selections are properly tracked and scored
- The MCQ summary accurately displays performance and highlights incorrect answers
- The application handles all error states gracefully
- UI is consistent with the existing application design

## Success Metrics
- User engagement with the MCQ feature (percentage of users choosing MCQs vs flashcards)
- Completion rate of MCQ sessions
- Average score on MCQ sessions
- User satisfaction and feedback

## Timeline
- Design and UI Planning: 1 week
- Implementation of study mode selection: 1 week
- MCQ generation implementation: 1 week
- MCQ interface development: 2 weeks
- MCQ summary screen development: 1 week
- Testing and refinement: 1 week
- Total estimated time: 7 weeks

## Future Plans
- Implement difficulty levels for MCQs (easy, medium, hard)
- Add the ability to retry incorrectly answered questions
- Provide explanations for correct answers
- Allow users to save their MCQ results for future reference
- Implement spaced repetition algorithms to prioritize questions based on performance

This PRD outlines a clear path for implementing a multiple choice question feature that enhances the existing AI Flashcard Generator, providing users with a more comprehensive study experience.
