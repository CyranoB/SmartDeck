# Implementation plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  **Initialize Project Repository:**

    *   Create a new repository (using Cursor starter kit as per Cursor Project Rules) called `flashcard-ai`.
    *   **Reference:** PRD

2.  **Set Up Development Environment:**

    *   Open the project in VS Code and create the main directory structure.
    *   **Reference:** Frontend Guidelines Document

3.  **Install Next.js 15 and TypeScript:**

    *   In the terminal, run:

    `npx create-next-app@15 flashcard-ai --typescript`

    *   Note: Next.js 15 is explicitly required for compatibility with our AI coding tools and LLM models.
    *   **Reference:** Tech Stack Document

4.  **Install Tailwind CSS and shadcn:**

    *   Follow Tailwind CSS installation for Next.js by running:

    `cd flashcard-ai npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer npx tailwindcss init -p`

    *   Integrate shadcn components by following their documentation.
    *   **Reference:** Frontend Guidelines Document

5.  **Validation:**

    *   Run `npm run dev` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to confirm the starter project is running.
    *   **Reference:** Windsurf File

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  **Create Home (Upload) Page:**

    *   Create `/pages/index.tsx` which will serve as the home screen with a file upload area.
    *   Implement a drag-and-drop interface using a React dropzone component.
    *   **Reference:** App Flow Document

2.  **Add File Selector Component:**

    *   Create `/components/FileUploader.tsx` for both drag-and-drop and file selector functionalities.
    *   Validate file type (.txt) and enforce a 50-word limit per file.
    *   **Reference:** PRD

3.  **Implement Multi-File Support:**

    *   Ensure `/components/FileUploader.tsx` accepts multiple files concurrently.
    *   **Reference:** PRD

4.  **Create Subject and Outline Display Screen:**

    *   Create `/pages/subject.tsx` to display the course subject and outline once AI processing is complete.
    *   Add a "Ready!" button to proceed to the flashcard interface.
    *   **Reference:** PRD

5.  **Build Flashcard Interface:**

    *   Create `/pages/flashcard.tsx` that shows the flashcards with a minimalist design.
    *   Add "Next" and "Stop" buttons to control flashcard generation and session termination.
    *   **Reference:** PRD

6.  **Integrate Visual Feedback:**

    *   Incorporate loading indicators and progress bars in all pages that trigger AI processing (e.g., while uploading or generating flashcards).
    *   Use shadcn UI components to maintain modern styling.
    *   **Reference:** PRD, Frontend Guidelines Document

7.  **Implement Multi-Lingual Support:**

    *   Add language selection components to enable English and French UI options.
    *   Configure language files and use Next.js localization capabilities.
    *   **Reference:** PRD

8.  **Validation:**

    *   Run `npm run dev` and manually test all UI components (file upload, subject display, flashcard interface, multi-lingual toggle) in the browser.
    *   **Reference:** App Flow Document

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  **Set Up Serverless API Routes:**

    *   In Next.js, create API endpoints under `/pages/api` to handle temporary data processing.
    *   **Reference:** Backend Structure Document

2.  **Transcript Upload API:**

    *   Create `/pages/api/upload.ts` to process uploaded transcript files.
    *   Validate that only plain text files are accepted and that the text does not exceed 50 words per file.
    *   Handle errors for incorrect file types or size violations.
    *   **Reference:** PRD, Backend Structure Document

3.  **Flashcard Generation API:**

    *   Create `/pages/api/generate.ts` to interact with the OpenAI GPT-4o-Mini model for generating subject outlines and flashcards.
    *   The endpoint should handle two actions: generating a new flashcard for "Next" and ending the session for "Stop" (which returns a session summary).
    *   **Reference:** PRD

4.  **Configuration Handling:**

    *   Create a config file at `/config/config.ts` storing the OpenAI API key, model name (defaulting to GPT-4o-Mini), and the API URL.
    *   **Reference:** PRD

5.  **Validation:**

    *   Test API endpoints locally using tools like Postman or curl to ensure proper error handling and response structure.
    *   For example, use curl to send a POST request to `/api/upload` and check for correct file validations.
    *   **Reference:** Backend Structure Document

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  **Integrate Frontend with File Upload API:**

    *   In `/pages/index.tsx`, implement a fetch call to `/api/upload` when the file upload component triggers an upload event.
    *   Display appropriate loading indicators during the process.
    *   **Reference:** App Flow Document

2.  **Link Subject Screen to AI Analysis:**

    *   After successful transcript upload, redirect the user to `/pages/subject.tsx` and populate it with data received from the AI processing in `/api/upload`.
    *   **Reference:** PRD

3.  **Integrate Flashcard Generation:**

    *   In `/pages/flashcard.tsx`, wire the "Next" button to call `/api/generate` to fetch and display a new flashcard and update progress visually.
    *   Wire the "Stop" button to call `/api/generate` to retrieve the session summary and then redirect to the home page.
    *   **Reference:** PRD

4.  **Integration Testing:**

    *   Manually test the full user workflow – upload transcript, view subject/outline, generate flashcards, and handle session end – ensuring proper error handling at each step.
    *   **Reference:** App Flow Document

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  **Set Up Vercel Deployment:**

    *   Create a Vercel project via V0 by Vercel and connect it to the GitHub repository.
    *   Configure the project for a Next.js application.
    *   **Reference:** Tech Stack Document

2.  **Configure Environmental Variables:**

    *   In the Vercel dashboard, set up environment variables including the OPENAI_API_KEY and any configuration necessary for the API URL.
    *   **Reference:** PRD

3.  **Deploy the Application:**

    *   Push the changes to the repository and let Vercel handle the deployment.
    *   **Reference:** Tech Stack Document

4.  **Validation:**

    *   Access the live site URL provided by Vercel and conduct end-to-end tests to confirm all functionalities (transcript upload, AI processing, flashcard generation, language toggle) are working as expected.
    *   **Reference:** Q&A

**Final Note:** Follow the project guidelines from the PRD, App Flow Document, Tech Stack Document, Frontend Guidelines Document, Backend Structure Document, and corresponding project rules files throughout development.
