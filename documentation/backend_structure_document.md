# Backend Structure Document

This document provides an overview of the backend structure for the modern flashcard website, ensuring clarity in design for both technical and non-technical readers. It explains how the system processes course transcripts, interacts with AI, and manages temporary session data.

## Backend Architecture

The backend is built using serverless functions that operate in a stateless manner. The following design patterns and frameworks are used to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance:

- **Serverless Functions:** The core business logic (upload processing, AI analysis, flashcard generation, session management) is implemented as separate serverless functions. This promotes a decoupled architecture that scales on demand.
- **Next.js API Routes:** Functions are organized as API endpoints within a Next.js framework, leveraging its built-in routing system. This choice simplifies deployment and maintenance.
- **Configuration Management:** A centralized configuration file holds sensitive API keys (such as the OpenAI key), model configurations, and default URLs. This ensures that adjustments to AI endpoints or credentials can be performed easily by the admin.
- **Stateless Sessions:** Since there is no long-term storage or user authentication, session state for flashcard sequences and transcript processing is managed in-memory or via temporary state transmissions between function calls.

## Database Management

Given that the project does not require long-term storage or user accounts, no traditional persistent database is used. Instead, focus is on transient data storage and efficient data processing during each session:

- **Ephemeral Data Handling:** Session data (e.g., uploaded transcript details and flashcard states) is stored temporarily in memory during a session and cleared afterwards.
- **Temporary Caching:** For performance, short-lived caching mechanisms may be implemented in-memory (or using built-in serverless function caching) to quickly handle repeat requests during a session.

## Database Schema

Since the application is designed for short-lived sessions without long-term data storage, a full-fledged database schema is not required. For clarity, here’s a human-readable outline of the data used during each session:

- **Session Data Structure:**
  - UserUploads: Contains information about each uploaded transcript file
    - FileName: Name of the uploaded file
    - WordCount: Validated count of words in the file
    - Content: The plain text content from the transcript
  - AIResults: Stores the results of the AI analysis
    - CourseSubject: Automatically detected course subject
    - CourseOutline: The generated outline details
  - Flashcards: An array of flashcard objects constructed from AIResults
    - FlashcardContent: The text to be reviewed or memorized by the student

*Note: If persistent storage were required in a future version, a SQL or NoSQL solution could be integrated based on needs, but the current design intentionally avoids long-term storage.*

## API Design and Endpoints

The API is designed with a RESTful approach, ensuring clear separation between different operations. Key endpoints include:

- **File Upload Endpoint (POST /api/upload):**
  - Accepts one or multiple transcript files with a 50-word limit per file.
  - Validates file size and content format before further processing.

- **AI Analysis Endpoint (POST /api/analyze):**
  - Receives the uploaded transcript content.
  - Invokes the OpenAI GPT-4o Mini to analyze the transcript, automatically determining the course subject and generating the course outline.

- **Flashcard Generation Endpoint (GET /api/flashcard):**
  - Returns the next generated flashcard based on the processed data.
  - Supports session navigation with a "Next" button functionality on the client side.

- **Session Stop and Summary Endpoint (POST /api/stop):**
  - Ends the current flashcard session.
  - Returns a summary of the session including all generated flashcards.
  - Resets the application state to the home/upload page once the summary is reviewed.

## Hosting Solutions

The backend is hosted on a cloud platform that supports serverless functions to achieve high reliability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Key aspects include:

- **Cloud Provider:** The serverless functions are deployed on a modern cloud service (potentially Vercel, AWS Lambda, or similar), providing:
  - **High Availability:** Automatic scaling based on demand ensures robust handling of requests.
  - **Cost Efficiency:** Pay-as-you-go pricing minimizes operational costs since functions run only during active sessions.
  - **Simplified Deployment:** Integration with the frontend built on Next.js enables smooth deployment and unified hosting.

## Infrastructure Components

Multiple infrastructure components work together to optimize performance and improve the user experience:

- **Load Balancers:** Automated traffic distribution across serverless instances ensures efficient utilization of resources and smooth handling of high traffic bursts.
- **Caching Mechanisms:** In-memory caching within serverless function environments speeds up repeated requests during a single session.
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** Static assets (like UI components) are served via CDNs to reduce latency and improve load times for users worldwide.

## Security Measures

Security in this project is approached in several layers despite the absence of user authentication and long-term data storage:

- **HTTPS Encryption:** All communications between the client and server occur over HTTPS, ensuring data is securely transmitted.
- **Input Validation and Sanitization:** File uploads are validated (e.g., checking word count and file type) to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- **Temporary Data Handling:** Since session data is not stored permanently, potential exposure is minimized. Any sensitive keys are stored in a secure, centralized configuration file.
- **Configuration File Protection:** The configuration file containing API keys and model settings is secured and only modifiable by the admin, following best practices for credential management.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Reliable monitoring and maintenance practices are in place to ensure the backend stays operational and high performing:

- **Performance Monitoring:** Tools provided by the cloud host (like Vercel Analytics or AWS CloudWatch) are used to monitor response times and error rates.
- **Application Logging:** Logging mechanisms capture detailed information about API calls and errors to facilitate troubleshooting.
- **Regular Updates:** The backend code is periodically reviewed and updated to incorporate security patches, optimize performance, and integrate new features if needed.
- **Proactive Alerts:** Automated alerts for performance anomalies or errors help expedite resolution of issues.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

In summary, the backend of this flashcard website is designed around a modern, serverless architecture that emphasizes scalability, performance, and quick responsiveness. Key takeaways include:

- A modular backend architecture, leveraging Next.js API routes, that separates transcript processing, AI analysis, and flashcard management.
- Usage of ephemeral data handling in place of persistent databases, aligning with the project requirement of no long-term storage.
- A RESTful API design ensuring clear communication between the frontend and backend, facilitating features like file uploads, flashcard navigation, and session summaries.
- Hosting on scalable, cost-effective cloud services with integrated load balancing, caching, and content delivery mechanisms to ensure a smooth user experience.
- Comprehensive security practices and monitoring strategies that prioritize user data safety and system reliability.

This backend setup is tailored to meet the project’s goals for ease of use, fast processing, and a clean, modern user experience, setting the stage for a robust flashcard generation application.
