# Tech Stack Document

This document explains the technology choices behind our modern flashcard website for university students, detailing how each component works together to achieve an intuitive, efficient, and visually appealing study assistant. The design employs clear, modern styling and leverages advanced AI integration, all while keeping the user experience uncomplicated and fast.

## Frontend Technologies

Our choice of frontend technologies ensures a responsive, accessible, and visually engaging interface:

*   **Next.js 14**

    *   Provides a modern React-based framework with server-side rendering, ensuring fast page loads and improved SEO.

*   **TypeScript**

    *   Adds strong typing to our codebase, reducing errors and enhancing maintainability during development.

*   **Tailwind CSS**

    *   A utility-first CSS framework that enables quick, efficient styling for a clean, modern look without writing extensive custom CSS.

*   **shadcn Component Library**

    *   Offers a set of pre-built, customizable UI components which help speed up development while maintaining design consistency and accessibility.

These technologies work together to deliver a seamless user experience with a fast, intuitive interface that guides students through uploading transcripts and navigating their flashcard study sessions.

## Backend Technologies

Even though our backend is relatively straightforward—with no user authentication or long-term data storage requirements—we have chosen a serverless approach to handle dynamic, on-the-fly processing:

*   **Serverless Architecture**

    *   Allows us to spin up computing resources only as needed, making it a cost-effective and scalable option. This is perfect for handling the temporary data while the AI processes the uploaded transcripts.

*   **Temporary Data Handling**

    *   Since no permanent data storage is required, transient session data is managed effectively within stateless serverless functions. This ensures privacy and minimizes maintenance overhead.

*   **AI Integration with OpenAI GPT-4o-Mini**

    *   Responsible for analyzing transcript content to generate the course subject, outline, and flashcards. The integration is streamlined to process text inputs quickly while providing real-time feedback to users.

The backend provides the critical support necessary for the dynamic generation of study aids while ensuring that each session remains independent and data privacy is maintained.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

Our infrastructure choices are geared towards reliability, scalability, and effortless deployment:

*   **Hosting with Vercel**

    *   Utilizes a modern platform optimized for Next.js applications, offering built-in support for serverless functions and seamless deployments.

*   **CI/CD Pipelines**

    *   Automated continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines ensure that updates are reliable and testing is integrated into the development cycle. Tools like GitHub Actions or similar services may be used.

*   **Version Control**

    *   Git (with platforms such as GitHub or GitLab) is used to maintain code integrity, track changes, and facilitate collaborative development.

These infrastructure decisions help maintain a robust environment that scales on demand and supports a smooth, iterative development process.

## Third-Party Integrations

To enhance functionality and streamline processes, the project incorporates several third-party services:

*   **OpenAI GPT-4o-Mini**

    *   The central AI component analyzes transcripts, generating course subjects, outlines, and flashcards. Its real-time processing capability is crucial for responsive study aid creation.

*   **Configurable Admin Settings**

    *   A configuration file allows administrators to set the OpenAI API key, select the model, and specify the default API URL. This flexibility ensures that the backend can be easily adapted to changes without affecting the frontend user experience.

These integrations allow us to deliver advanced features such as natural language processing and dynamic content generation without reinventing the wheel.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security and performance are paramount in delivering a reliable and user-friendly experience:

*   **Security Measures:**

    *   Data is managed transiently, with no long-term storage of user information, reducing risks associated with data breaches.
    *   Sensitive configuration settings, such as the OpenAI API key, are stored securely in a config file rather than within the visible frontend code.

*   **Performance Optimizations:**

    *   The serverless architecture ensures that AI processes only run on-demand, improving response times and minimizing idle resource usage.
    *   The use of Next.js server-side rendering boosts initial load times and general responsiveness.
    *   Visual feedback components like loading indicators and progress bars keep the user informed during processing delays, maintaining a smooth overall experience.

Collectively, implementing robust security practices and focused performance enhancements guarantees that users enjoy a secure, fast, and efficient study session.
